### Task 6: Rebase and Sync

I just used a merge since the branch was already merged into main and no issues arised.

### Task 7: Recover Lost Commit (Bonus)

File recovered helpers.txt

## Final Deliverables

2.a: merge, rebase, reflog, cherry-pick, add, commit, revert, stash
2.c: going through the instructions and understanding what happened and what was needed.
2.d: clear guidelines and protocols for code quality and colaboration.
2.e: First time I had to "split" a commit in the history.

## Submission notes

I had to use git stash at the beginning for some reason.
